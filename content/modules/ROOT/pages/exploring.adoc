= Exploring the Lab

The lab is designed to be interactive and hands-on, allowing you to explore the capabilities of LlamaStack and OpenShift AI in a practical setting. The lab environment is pre-configured with all necessary components, so you can focus on learning and experimentation without worrying about setup or configuration issues.

== OpenShift Console

Log in to the cluster: Navigate to the OpenShift cluster and login with the provided credentials.

The URL for the OpenShift console is: {{ openshift_console_url }}

You will see two models running via the RHOAI vLLM ServingRuntime:

* granite3.2-8b
* llama3.2-3b

=== Jupyter Notebook Workbench

To launch the Jupyter notebook workbench use the following link https://lab-llama-serve.{{ openshift_cluster_ingress_domain }}/notebook/llama-serve/lab/lab or follow the steps as shown below:

Your Jupyter workbench can be found in `Data science projects` (located on the left hand side of the console). Select the project `llama-serve`:
