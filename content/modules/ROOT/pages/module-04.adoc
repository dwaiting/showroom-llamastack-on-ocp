= Level 3: Advanced Agents with Prompt Chaining & ReAct

In this notebook, we will be using Llama Stack to build an advanced agent with prompt chaining and ReAct functionalities.

[[focus]]
== Focus

Implementing advanced agent patterns including prompt chaining and ReAct framework for complex reasoning and structured decision-making.

[[learning-objective]]
== Learning Objective

* *Understand how to build agents that are capable of complex reasoning through prompt chaining*
* *Employ the ReAct framework for structured action planning*
* *Learn how to integrate effective prompt chains for multi-turn interactions*

[[task-example]]
== Task Example

Users will build an agent that uses prompt chaining to break down complex problems and the ReAct framework to reason through actions systematically.

[[expected-agent-behavior]]
== Expected Agent Behavior

The agent should demonstrate structured thinking, break complex tasks into manageable steps, and use the ReAct pattern (Reason-Act-Observe) for systematic problem-solving.

[[key-concepts-demonstrated]]
== Key Concepts Demonstrated

* Prompt chaining techniques for multi-step reasoning
* ReAct framework implementation and usage
* Complex task decomposition and execution
* Structured action planning and decision-making
