= Level 6: Agentic MCP and RAG

In this notebook, we will be building an advanced agent that interacts with multiple tools including external MCP tools and the built-in Llama Stack RAG tool.

[[focus]]
== Focus

Creating a comprehensive incident response system that combines advanced agentic patterns, RAG-based knowledge retrieval, and MCP-driven external system interactions.

[[learning-objective]]
== Learning Objective

* *Understand how to combine advanced agentic capabilities* including prompt chaining, RAG-based knowledge retrieval, and MCP-driven OpenShift and Slack interactions, into a cohesive incident response system.
* *Learn how to design prompts that guide the agent through complex tasks* 
* *Learn how to leverage RAG to inject relevant contextual information for problem-solving* 
* *Learn how to utilize MCP tools to execute actions within our infrastructure and communicate findings effectively.*

[[task-example]]
== Task Example

Users will build a complete automated incident response system that can analyze problems, search for solutions, interact with infrastructure, and communicate findings.

[[expected-agent-behavior]]
== Expected Agent Behavior

The agent should demonstrate sophisticated problem-solving capabilities, efficiently combine multiple information sources, execute infrastructure actions, and provide comprehensive incident reports.

[[key-concepts-demonstrated]]
== Key Concepts Demonstrated

* Advanced multi-tool agent orchestration
* Integrated RAG and MCP workflow design
* Complex incident response automation
* Enterprise-grade agent architecture patterns

== Slack Pre-Requisite

We will be interacting with a Slack MCP server in this notebook for which you will need to join the public Slack channel workspace using this invite link: https://join.slack.com/t/octo-emerging-tech/shared_invite/zt-35pmx4q0i-OFwWNE6nIcPEmbM7YS55yg

Once logged into the workspace make sure to join the link:https://app.slack.com/client/T08M9UTL2DC/C08MUDSNHED[#demos] channel.
