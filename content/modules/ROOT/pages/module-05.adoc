= Level 4: Agentic RAG

In this notebook we will be building a RAG agent using Llama Stack.

[[focus]]
== Focus

Integrating RAG capabilities within an autonomous agent framework that can decide when to retrieve information versus answering directly.

[[learning-objective]]
== Learning Objective

* *Understand how to define and implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) within an AI agent framework*
* *How to enable agents to autonomously decide when to use RAG and when to answer questions directly*

[[task-example]]
== Task Example

Users will create an intelligent agent that autonomously decides when to use RAG for information retrieval versus answering questions from its existing knowledge.

[[expected-agent-behavior]]
== Expected Agent Behavior

The agent should intelligently assess queries, determine the need for additional information, retrieve relevant documents when necessary, and provide well-informed responses.

[[key-concepts-demonstrated]]
== Key Concepts Demonstrated

* Autonomous decision-making for tool usage
* Strategic integration of RAG within agent workflows
* Dynamic query assessment and response planning
* Intelligent information retrieval and synthesis
