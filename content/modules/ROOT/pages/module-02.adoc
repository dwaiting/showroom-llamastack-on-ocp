= Level 1 - Simple RAG

In this notebook we will be using Llama Stack to run a simple RAG example.

[[focus]]
== Focus

Building a simple RAG application using Llama Stack to understand the fundamentals of document retrieval and question answering.

[[learning-objective]]
== Learning Objective

*Understand the core mechanics of RAG and Vector Databases in LlamaStack.*

* *Vector Database Interaction*: How to connect to a vector database, insert documents and submit queries.
* *Retrieval Mechanism:* How LlamaStack identifies and extracts relevant information.
* *Basic Question Answering:* Using retrieved content in conjunction with inference to generate dataset specific answers.

[[task-example]]
== Task Example

Users will work with a vector database to index documents and perform semantic searches to answer questions using retrieved context.

[[expected-agent-behavior]]
== Expected Agent Behavior

The system should retrieve relevant documents from the vector database and use them to provide accurate, contextual answers to user queries.

[[key-concepts-demonstrated]]
== Key Concepts Demonstrated

* Vector database operations and document indexing
* Semantic search and retrieval mechanisms
* Basic RAG architecture and workflow
* Integration of retrieval and generation components

To execute the notebook cells, navigate to the top toolbar. Click the fast-forward (‚è©) icon to restart the kernel and execute all cells sequentially from top to bottom. Alternatively, you can click the play (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) icon to run individual cells one at a time. If you need to restart the kernel, you can do so by clicking the (üîÑ) icon.
