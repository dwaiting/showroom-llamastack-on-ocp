= Exploring the Lab

The lab is designed to be interactive and hands-on, allowing you to explore the capabilities of LlamaStack and OpenShift AI in a practical setting. The lab environment is pre-configured with all necessary components, so you can focus on learning and experimentation without worrying about setup or configuration issues.
