= Level 6: Agentic MCP and RAG

In this notebook, we will be building an advanced agent that interacts with multiple tools including external MCP tools and the built-in Llama Stack RAG tool.

== Learning Objectives

* *Understand how to combine advanced agentic capabilities* including prompt chaining, RAG-based knowledge retrieval, and MCP-driven OpenShift and Slack interactions, into a cohesive incident response system.
* *Learn how to design prompts that guide the agent through complex tasks* 
* *Learn how to leverage RAG to inject relevant contextual information for problem-solving* 
* *Learn how to utilize MCP tools to execute actions within our infrastructure and communicate findings effectively.*
