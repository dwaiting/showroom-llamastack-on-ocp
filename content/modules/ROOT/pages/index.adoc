= Llama Stack on OpenShift Lab
This lab provides a comprehensive, hands-on experience developing intelligent AI agents with OpenShift, Llama Stack and Model Context Protocol (MCP). Participants will learn how to build agents that can use a wide variety of tools to increase their access to different data sources and interact with external systems. This will be done by building an AI agent that has access to a RAG tool, an OpenShift MCP and a Slack MCP tool. This agent will be capable of reviewing pod logs, searching our vector database for specific solutions, and sending results to Slack. This agent will be built, step-by-step through a series of progressive Jupyter notebooks on Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI).

[[rhoai-model-deployment-via-vllm]]
== RHOAI model deployment via vLLM

RHOAI model deployment makes LLMs accessible as scalable and manageable API endpoints. This enables developers and data scientists to integrate these models with LLama Stack applications. For our lab, we use https://docs.vllm.ai/[vLLM] as a runtime for RHOAI model deployment. vLLM is an open-source, high-performance inference engine designed to optimize the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-time applications. At its core, vLLM introduces the PagedAttention algorithm, which draws inspiration from operating system paging techniques to manage key-value (KV) cache memory efficiently.

[[models]]
=== Models

For this lab, we deploy one LLM model using Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) and we will utilze a second model that is remotely hosted outside of the cluster. The models are:

* IBM Granite 3.2 8B Instruct:  is an 8-billion-parameter, long-context AI model fine-tuned for thinking capabilities. Built on top of Granite-3.1-8B-Instruct, it has been trained using a mix of permissively licensed open-source datasets and internally generated synthetic data designed for reasoning tasks. The model allows controllability of its thinking capability, ensuring it is applied only when required.
* Meta LLama 3.2 3B Instruct: The Llama 3.2 collection of multilingual large language models (LLMs) is a collection of pretrained and instruction-tuned generative models in 1B and 3B sizes (text in/text out). The Llama 3.2 instruction-tuned text only models are optimized for multilingual dialogue use cases, including agentic retrieval and summarization tasks. They outperform many of the available open source and closed chat models on common industry benchmarks.

We use the IBM Granite 3.2 8B Instruct model as a default in all the notebooks for a consistent performance. However, you can also experiment and try out the Meta LLama 3.2 3B Instruct model to compare the performance and characteristics of both the models.

[[built-in-tools-with-llama-stack]]
=== Built-in Tools with Llama Stack

Llama Stack provides built-in tools to extend the capabilities of agents. We leverage the following built-in tools in this lab:

*RAG*
The Llama Stack https://llama-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building_applications/rag.html[RAG] tool facilitates document ingestion and semantic search using vector databases such as Milvus and FAISS. It supports ingesting documents from various sources like URLs and files, automatically chunking them for processing. For semantic search in this demo, the tool utilizes the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model to embed the document chunks.

*Websearch*
The https://llama-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building_applications/tools.html#web-search-providers[WebSearch] tool enables agents to conduct web searches using providers like Brave, Bing, and Tavily. This tool requires an API key from the selected search provider. Our demos utilizes Tavily Search and a Tavily API key to gather real time information.

[[model-context-protocol-servers]]
== Model Context Protocol Servers

The open-source https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction[Model Context Protocol] defines a standard way to connect LLMs to nearly any type of external resources like files, APIs, and databases. It’s built on a client-server system, so applications can easily feed LLMs the context they need.

[[servers]]
=== Servers
In this lab, we use two MCP servers, an OpenShift MCP server and a Slack MCP server, both of which are deployed in the OpenShift environment.

*OpenShift MCP Server*

The https://github.com/manusa/kubernetes-mcp-server[OpenShift Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server] lets LLMs interact directly with Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters without needing additional software like kubectl or Helm. It enables operations such as managing pods, viewing logs, installing Helm charts, listing namespaces, etc.—all through a unified interface. This server is lightweight and doesn't require any external dependencies, making it easy to integrate into existing systems. In the advanced level notebooks, we use this server to connect to the OpenShift cluster, check the status of pods running on the cluster, and report their health and activity.

*Slack MCP Server*

The https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/slack[Slack MCP Server]` offers a standard interface for LLMs to interact with Slack workspaces. Its capabilities include listing channels, posting messages, replying to threads, adding emoji reactions, retrieving message history, and accessing user profiles. This enables AI agents to seamlessly engage in Slack conversations, manage communication, and gain insights from user context.  In the advanced level notebooks, we use this server to connect to a public Slack workspace and send status updates about our running pods, along with error resolution steps.
